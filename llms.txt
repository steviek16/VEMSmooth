# VEMSmooth

**VEMSmooth** implements the Variational Expectation-Maximization (VEM)
Bayesian Basis Selection method for **Functional Data Analysis (FDA)**.
It builds upon the work of *da Cruz, de Souza and da Sousa (2024)*,
providing a fast, scalable Bayesian basis selection alternative.

This package is developed as part of the Data Science 4999z Thesis
Project at Western University.

## Installation

You can install the development version of VEMSmooth from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("steviek16/VEMSmooth")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(VEMSmooth)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
